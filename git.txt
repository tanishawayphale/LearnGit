What is Git?
Git is a version control system.
It helps you track changes to your files and collaborate with other people on projects.

Imagine you are writing a document. Every time you make changes, Git can save a snapshot of the document at that moment.
If you make a mistake, you can go back to an earlier version easily.

Itâ€™s mostly used for software development, but you can use Git to track changes in any set of files (even text files, images, etc.).

Why is Git Important?
Keeps history of every change you make.

Collaborates with many people without overwriting each other's work.

Backups your work safely.

Branching: You can create separate branches to try new ideas without affecting your main work
